function FirstFactorial(num) { 
  if (num <= 1) {                         //Recursion base case: the branch of the if-statement that halts the function from calling itself forever
    return 1;                             //Our base case: if num is less than or equal to 1 (aka num is 1), then return 1
      }
  else {
    return num * FirstFactorial(num-1);         //num multiplied by the entire Function(but this time with the value of the parameter less one)
  }      
}


// So, we are decreasing the num by 1 each time, but that would go on forever were it not for the base case, 
//where the value 1 is substituted in for num as soon as num reaches 1.
// Example where user input is 4:
// num === 4
// FirstFactorial(4)
// 4 * FF(4-1)
//        3       * FF(3-1)
//                    2         * FF(2-1)
//                                  1
// === 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
