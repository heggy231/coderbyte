coderbyte
=========

Each easy Coderbyte Challenge, with answers analyzed step by step. 

I started running through the "easy" coderbyte challenges on 11/30/13. This was originally done as preparation for my applying to Hack Reactor. With the help of Google, I was able to stumble across leaena's answers:

https://github.com/leaena/coderbyte

^ Without her help, I would've struggled mightily on the latter half of the easy challenges. For the most part (aka when she doesn't use regex's, which I haven't learned yet... wah wah wah), her answers are clear and concise, which helped me tremendously in my reverse-engineering/analyzing of her answers. Analyzing other people's code has played a large role in my learning javascript. So thank you Leaena.

Anywho, I'm going to put these up one by one, as I have to run through them all again anyways. Gotta be able to get these coded within 5 minutes foo!

Note: Doing this helped me in 2 ways - #1: it forced me to go through each challenge over and over again until I engrained the rules to be taken from each one. Explaining and teaching helps you consolidate what you've learned (helps you gain mastery of the material). And #2: this is the first real "project" I used github with. So I learned github basics such as: git add and git commit -m and git push -u origin master. Coming from someone who didn't know diddly-squat about github, learning the basics gives me all the confidence in the world!.. not really, but it's a start...

*Note: I'm currently going through the first several chapters of Eloquent Javascript - and I just learned that it's wrong to say that a variable "contains" a value. I used that sort of terminology throughout these explanations, so please disregard those instances of un-eloquent javascript explanations on my part. It would've been more appropriate to say something like, "the variable VAR1 points at the value -blah- -blah- -blah-" as opposed to what I said ("the variable VAR1 contains the value etc etc etc").
