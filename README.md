Coderbyte Challenges analyzed line for line.

I started running through the "easy" coderbyte challenges on 11/30/13. This was originally done as preparation for my applying to Hack Reactor. With the help of Google, I was able to stumble across leaena's answers:

https://github.com/leaena/coderbyte

^ Without her help, I would've struggled mightily on the latter half of the easy challenges. For the most part (aka when she doesn't use regex's, which I haven't learned yet... wah wah wah), her answers are clear and concise, which helped me tremendously in my reverse-engineering/analyzing of her answers. Analyzing other people's code has pplayed a big role in my learning javascript. So thank you Leaena.

Anywho, I'm going to put these up one by one, as I have to run through them all again anyways. Gotta be able to get these coded within 5 minutes foo!
